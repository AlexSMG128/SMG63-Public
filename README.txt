Alright, you want to set up this mod? Here's how! (Guide written by SPG64)
(NOTE THAT THIS MOD IS ONLY SUPPORTED FOR THE US PAL AND JPN VERSIONS OF SUPER MARIO GALAXY 2)

PLAYING ON CONSOLE:

If you're playing on a Nintendo Wii or Wii U, you'll need to find out how to get and use:
- The Homebrew Channel
- Riivolution
- You'll also need your own Super Mario Galaxy 2 Disc

I won't be providing a guide on how to install the homebrew channel or riivolution,
so please go and research how to do that stuff yourself if you don't know how to already.

Once you put the mod and riivolution files on your SD Card/USB Device, all you need to do is enable the mod and start playing!

PLAYING ON DOLPHIN EMULATOR:

To load this mod on Dolphin, you need your own copy of Super Mario Galaxy 2 and a fairly recent version of Dolphin too.

In your Dolphin game library, right click your Super Mario Galaxy 2 game and click "Start with Riivolution Patches".
This feature is only available on more recent versions of Dolphin Emulator. Once you click "Start with Riivolution Patches",
you want to select "Open Riivolution XML" and open the .xml file included in the Super Mario Galaxy 63 download.

If you're using the PAL version of Super Mario Galaxy 2 then select the "SMG63FULL_PAL.xml".
If you're using the USA version of Super Mario Galaxy 2 then select the "SMG63FULL_USA.xml".
If you're using the JPN version of Super Mario Galaxy 2 then select the "SMG63FULL_JPN.xml".

Once you've done that, you just enable Super Mario Galaxy 63 and click the start button.

If you have any further questions about setting up this mod, please ask us in the Super Mario Galaxy 63
